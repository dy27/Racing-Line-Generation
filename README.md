# Racing-Line-Generation
 \* DOCUMENTATION IN PROGRESS *
 
This program reads in a list of waypoints of a racing track and the track width at each waypoint, and generates an approximation of an optimal racing line based on a node traversal algorithm. The algorithm minimises a combination of two parameters: shortest distance and minimal angle change. Each parameter has its own weight, which can be calibrated for better results.

The algorithm used does not reflect a true racing line, this is mostly just for entertainment.
